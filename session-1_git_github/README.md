# Session 1: Git for Scientists

Version control is an essential skill for anyone working with code and data in the life sciences. Whether you're writing scripts, managing analysis pipelines, or collaborating with team members, Git helps ensure your work is organized, reproducible, and well-documented.

In this session, we will cover:

- Why version control is important in bioinformatics
- How to configure Git and connect it to GitHub
- Basic Git commands to manage changes in your projects
- How to use remote repositories for collaboration
- Best practices for maintaining reproducible code

We will start with a brief introduction to why Git is needed in scientific computing and then work through each concept with hands-on steps.

## Chapter 1: Why Use Git in Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics projects typically involve multiple scripts, data files, and analysis steps. These components often change as the project evolves. Without a version control system, it's difficult to track what was changed, when, and why. This can lead to lost work, conflicting file versions, and difficulties reproducing results.

Git addresses these issues by enabling you to:

- Record snapshots of your project over time
- Restore previous versions if needed
- Track and review changes to your code and files
- Collaborate efficiently with others without overwriting each other's work

Using Git is a foundational skill that supports good research practices, especially when working on complex or long-term projects.
